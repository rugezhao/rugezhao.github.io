Hi! I'm a data scientist at Quora. I recently graduated from Stanford University with a Master in Statistics. 

Before coming to Bay Area, I lived in Singapore for 7 years: I received my Bachelor in Statistics from National University of Singapore and worked at Bloomberg's Singapore office as a data analyst.

In my free time, I am a big fan of bouldering (a type of rock climbing)üßó‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
